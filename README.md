# Hospital-Management-Project
This project is based on the concept of “HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT” with the help of concepts of classes, objects and data file handling, this project is capable of keeping record of the doctors and the patients that have visited the hospital, which has been given a fictitious name “Sandhu Lifecare Hospital” before going on with the study of program code, it is necessary that one understands the pre-conditions that have been assumed for making the program simple, more presentable and easier to understand. These are as follows:- All the doctors and patients have unique name. Wherever date is asked, it is entered as per the following format:- date&lt;&lt;/>>month&lt;&lt;/>>year  Variable for storing the values for age and gender are strings, so gender is entered in this way:- value of age &lt; > years This project just gives a simple idea how a record of various doctors and patients can be kept in hospital. With better knowledge of C++ and the use of more functions, the program can be made more user friendly and practically applicable. In present form this project just gives a reflection of how management may be done in organization such as hospital with the help of simple functions for adding, reading, searching, updating and deleting the records.
